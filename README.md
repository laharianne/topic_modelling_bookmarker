# topic_modelling_bookmarker
The git repo is contains the source code for an topic modelling bookmarker google extension. (Team 009 Spring 2024 UIUC CS 510 course project)

We propose to develop a standalone tool, a Google Chrome extension, that provides topic suggestions for bookmarking web pages based on their content. The major functions of the tool include:
● Scanning web page content to suggest relevant topics for bookmarking.
● Performing sentiment analysis to determine the tone of the page.
● Allowing users to search for bookmarks based on topics within the extension.
Our software tool/system users are individuals who frequently bookmark web pages for reference or research purposes. This tool will be particularly useful for students, researchers, professionals, and anyone who wants to organize and categorize their online content efficiently.
